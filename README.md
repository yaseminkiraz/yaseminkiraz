My background is in Computer Engineering at Kocaeli University, Turkey. 

Currently, i live in Berlin. I am working as a Software Engineer.

### How I See My Role
I’d describe my role in general as aspiring Software Craftsperson. (I don’t like other callings [here](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2018/05/02/Craftsman-Craftswoman-Craftsperson.html).) I already [signed](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/#/en) the manifesto to push forward my/our values.


> We are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft.



### How I Like to Work
I put value and like on the things while working:

* Pairing, sharing, communicating and empathising,

* All different ideas,

* Having fun but thoughtfully,

* Psychologically safety,

* Growing and learning together,

* Not only working software, but also well-crafted software,

* Having resilience in problem-solving,

* Thinking pragmatically.
